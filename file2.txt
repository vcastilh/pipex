Make love and not war! 'Cause we don't need no trouble$
What we need is love (love)$
If you hope good down from above (love)$
What we need is love (What we need is love sweet love) Oh, no!$
Come on, you all, and speak of love (Sad enough without yourfoes)$
What we need is love now (What we need is love!)$
What we need is love (love)$
I beg you to speak of love (Sad enough without your foes)$
What we need is love!$
